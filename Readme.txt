Huffman coding, invented by David A. Huffman in 1952, is a widely used algorithm for lossless data compression. It is a variable-length prefix coding algorithm that assigns variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes assigned to more frequent characters, resulting in more efficient compression.
